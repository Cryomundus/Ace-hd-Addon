// Do keep in mind that this list is incomplete and credits are missing because some of these sprites are used in a lot of places. It's redonkulously difficult to remember all of these.

Sprites:
- Pickups are mostly from Trailblazer. Some are from Freedoom. The ones I know for sure I'll credit in detail.
- Player sprite I dug up from some skin pack I downloaded some five years ago. No idea where it's from. No credits in the skin pack from what I see.
- Chainsaw: /vr/ anon (that's what Zik's credits say)
- SMG: DoomNukem, silentzora. Reflex sight by a1337spy.
- Pistol: Freedoom Team
- Revolver: Originally by Solid Steak in the DoomNukem resources thread, edits by Accensus.
- Hunter: Originally from Doom64, edited by osjclatchford. Got it from the Spriting Carnival.
- Slayer: Originally by DoomNukem. Longer barrel by me.
- ZM66: Originally by Sonik.O.Fan (it's Quake 4's assault rifle), edits by Accensus.
- Vulcanette: Eriance, Snarboo, Uboa, Midway Studios, Mike12 (credits taken from ZikShadow's HD addon which this one is based on)
- Grenade Launcher: No idea. It's familiar but I don't recall where I've seen it.
- Rocket Launcher: Demon Eclipse, Sergeant_Mark_IV
- Thunder Buster: BouncyTEM? That's what Zik's credits say.
- Liberator: No idea.
- Boss Rifle: No idea. Definitely took it from the Spriting Carnival if I recall correctly. Was a while ago.
- BFG: Sonik.O.Fan
- Brontornis: No idea. Mor'ladim gave it to me. Seems to be a frankensprite.
- ZM69: Also no idea.

- Merchant: Strife (Rogue)

- Baron of hell: Dunno, but I've seen it used in a lot of places.
- Demon: Eriance, IIRC.
- Imp: Eriance
- Putto: Definitely looks like it's by Eriance. Taken from Freedoom.

All sprite edits are done by Accensus.

Graphics:
- All the sight edits are by Accensus.
- Mugshot sprite taken from Trailblazer. Either PillowBlaster or DoomNukem did it. My money is on DoomNukem.

// Oh boy, I don't even know where to begin. It's been a very long time since I've changed the sounds so forgive me if I don't know precisely where they're from.
Sounds:
- a1337spy's InsurgencySfx addon for HD.
- Trailblazer
- Russian Overkill
- Guncaster (Say what you will, PillowBlaster knows his sounds)
- kodi (Shotgun fire)

Code:
- Merchant by Accensus. Edits to Caligari's shader and Tartlman/bogus' ZM69 also by me.
